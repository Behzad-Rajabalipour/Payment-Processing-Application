# Payment Processing Application

## Setup and Run Instructions

To get started with this application, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Application Architecture

This React-based application is designed to simulate a payment processing system. It is structured into several key components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use:

- **PaymentPortal**: The main entry point for users to select a payment method and enter payment details.
- **PaymentMethodSelector**: Allows users to choose from available payment methods.
- **PaymentForm**: Dynamically renders a form based on the selected payment method.
- **ConfirmationPage**: Displays a confirmation message with transaction details upon form submission.

The application leverages React Router for navigation, ensuring a seamless user experience without full page reloads.

### Design Choices

- **Modular Design**: Components are designed to be reusable and encapsulated, facilitating future extensions.
- **Plugin System**: Payment methods are implemented as plugins, allowing for easy addition of new methods without altering the core codebase.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` and `useContext` for state management, striking a balance between simplicity and functionality.

## Adding a New Payment Method Plugin

To add a new payment method to the application, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Plugin**: Under the `plugins/PaymentPlugins` directory, create a new file for your plugin, e.g., `YourPaymentMethod.js`. This file should export a React component that renders the payment form specific to your new method.

2. **Integrate the Plugin**: In the `plugins/PaymentPlugins/plugins.js` file, import your new payment method component and add it to the exported `paymentPlugins` object, like so:

   ```javascript
   import YourPaymentMethod from './YourPaymentMethod';

   const paymentPlugins = {
     // other payment methods...
     yourPaymentMethod: YourPaymentMethod,
   };

   export default paymentPlugins;
   ```

3. **Test Your Plugin**: Start the application and navigate to the payment portal. Your new payment method should now appear as an option in the `PaymentMethodSelector`.

By following these steps, you can easily extend the application to support additional payment methods, ensuring the system remains flexible and user-friendly.
